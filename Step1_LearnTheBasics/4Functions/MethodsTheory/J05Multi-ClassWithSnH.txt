Absolutely 🔥 You're ready to understand **multi-class memory interaction** in Java — where the **main method**, **other classes**, and **method calls** work together and how **stack** and **heap memory** behave in this scenario.

Let’s go step-by-step in the same visual style you liked.

## 🧾 Code Example — Multi-Class with Stack & Heap Involved

```java
class Student {
    int id;
    String name;
    
    void display() {
        System.out.println(id + " " + name);
    }
}

class School {
    Student getStudent() {
        Student s = new Student();
        s.id = 101;
        s.name = "Shatrughan";
        return s;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        School school = new School();
        Student student = school.getStudent();
        student.display();
    }
}
```

## 🔍 Our Focus

We will track:

* `main()` method
* `getStudent()` method
* `Student` and `School` objects
* Stack and Heap flow

---

## 🔷 STEP-WISE EXECUTION

### ✅ Step 1: Program Starts → `main()` is called

🧠 **Stack:**

```
| main() frame                      |
------------------------------------
```

🧠 **Heap:**

```
(empty)
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: `School school = new School();`

* A new object of `School` class is created in **heap** at `0xSC01`
* `school` reference stored in `main()` frame

🧠 **Stack:**

```
| school → 0xSC01                  |
| main() frame                     |
-----------------------------------
```

🧠 **Heap:**

```
0xSC01 → School object (no fields, but methods exist)
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: `Student student = school.getStudent();`

1. Method `getStudent()` is called — a **new stack frame** is pushed
2. Inside that, a `Student` object is created at `0xST01`
3. Fields `id` and `name` are initialized
4. The reference `s` is returned to `main()`

🧠 **Stack:**

```
| s → 0xST01                        |
| getStudent() frame               |
|----------------------------------|
| school → 0xSC01                  |
| student → ?                      |
| main() frame                     |
-----------------------------------
```

🧠 **Heap:**

```
0xSC01 → School object
0xST01 → Student {
    id = 101,
    name = "Shatrughan"
}
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Returning to `main()` with returned reference

* `getStudent()` frame is **popped**
* Returned reference `0xST01` is stored in `student`

🧠 **Stack:**

```
| school → 0xSC01                  |
| student → 0xST01                 |
| main() frame                     |
-----------------------------------
```

🧠 **Heap:**

```
0xSC01 → School object
0xST01 → Student {
    id = 101,
    name = "Shatrughan"
}
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: `student.display();`

* `display()` is called — new frame added
* It accesses `id` and `name` from heap

🧠 **Stack:**

```
| this → 0xST01                    |
| display() frame                  |
|----------------------------------|
| school → 0xSC01                  |
| student → 0xST01                 |
| main() frame                     |
-----------------------------------
```

🧠 **Heap:**

```
0xSC01 → School object
0xST01 → Student {
    id = 101,
    name = "Shatrughan"
}
```

🖨️ Console Output:

```
101 Shatrughan
```

---

### ✅ Final Step: `display()` and `main()` finish

* `display()` → stack frame gone
* `main()` → stack frame gone
* Now: if **no other references to heap objects remain**, both heap objects become eligible for **garbage collection**

🧠 **Stack:**

```
(empty)
```

🧠 **Heap (Garbage Collector eligible):**

```
0xSC01 → School object ❌
0xST01 → Student object ❌
```

## ✅ Summary

| Concept                       | Memory                      | Example                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Local variables, method calls | **Stack**                   | `school`, `student`, `this`           |
| `new` objects                 | **Heap**                    | `new Student()`, `new School()`       |
| Method calls                  | New Stack Frames            | `main()`, `getStudent()`, `display()` |
| References removed            | When stack frame is removed | Objects become GC-eligible            |

Want me to draw an actual memory diagram (image) for this code? I can generate it for visual clarity too!






What is this Exactly?
In Java, this is a keyword that refers to the current object — the one on which the method is being called.

In our case:

void display() {
    System.out.println(id + " " + name);
}

Behind the scenes, Java treats this as:

void display(Student this) {
    System.out.println(this.id + " " + this.name);
}
So,

this.id → 101

this.name → "Shatrughan"

These are accessed directly from the heap object that this points to.

Heap Memory:

0xSC01 → School object

0xST01 → Student object {
              id = 101,
              name = "Shatrughan"
          }

3. Final Console Output
System.out.println(id + " " + name);

Since:

this.id = 101

this.name = "Shatrughan"

🖨️ Output:
101 Shatrughan
