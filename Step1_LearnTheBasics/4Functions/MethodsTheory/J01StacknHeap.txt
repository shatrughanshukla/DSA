I'm really glad the previous explanation helped, Shatrughan! 🙌
Now let’s deep dive into your **new doubt** — this is **one of the most fundamental and powerful concepts** to understand in Java:

---

## 🔍 Topic: **Stack vs Heap Memory in Java**

And how **Objects**, **Classes**, and **Methods** are connected to these.

---

## 📦 1. **What is Stack Memory?**

* Stack memory is used for **method execution**.
* It stores:

  * Local variables (like `int x = 5;`)
  * Method parameters
  * References to objects
  * Function call history (call stack)

> 🧠 Stack is **fast** and managed automatically. When a method ends, all its stack memory is cleared.

### 🔁 Think of Stack like:

```
| change(x)  |
| main()     |
-------------
```

Each method call adds a *frame* on top of the stack.

---

## 🧠 2. **What is Heap Memory?**

* Heap is used to **store objects and arrays**.
* Every time you do `new`, Java creates memory on the **heap**.
* Object fields (instance variables) live here.

> 🧠 Heap is **shared globally** across methods and threads. Garbage Collector frees it when not used anymore.

---

## 🧵 3. **How Java Uses Both (Real-Life Example)**

```java
class Student {
    int id;
    String name;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student();
        s1.id = 101;
        s1.name = "Shatrughan";
    }
}
```

### 🔎 Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. `main()` method is called → **stack frame** is created.
2. `Student s1 = new Student();`

   * A **reference variable `s1`** is stored in **stack**.
   * The actual `Student` object (with `id`, `name`) is stored in **heap**.
   * `s1` holds a reference (say, `0xABCD`) to the heap object.
3. `s1.id = 101;` modifies heap data.

```
🧠 Stack:

| s1 --> 0xABCD |
| main()        |

🧠 Heap:

0xABCD → Student {
    id = 101,
    name = "Shatrughan"
}
```

---

## 💡 4. **What happens during Method Call?**

```java
void printStudent(Student s) {
    System.out.println(s.name);
}

printStudent(s1);
```

### 📌 Memory view:

* `s` is a **new reference variable in stack** → it gets a **copy of the reference** `0xABCD`.
* Both `s1` and `s` point to **same object in heap**.
* Changes inside `s` affect the same object.

```
Stack:
| s --> 0xABCD |
| s1 --> 0xABCD |
| main()        |

Heap:
0xABCD → Student {
    id = 101,
    name = "Shatrughan"
}
```

## 🔥 Final Summary Table

| Feature      | Stack                      | Heap                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Used for     | Method calls, local vars   | Objects, arrays         |
| Lifetime     | Short-lived (method scope) | Long-lived (until GC)   |
| Access Speed | Fast                       | Slower                  |
| Storage      | Primitives & object refs   | Actual objects & arrays |
| Cleared When | Method returns             | Garbage Collected       |

## 🧠 Bonus Analogy

> 🔗 Think of `stack` as your **desk** (limited space, fast access),
> and `heap` as your **cupboard** (stores heavy items you reference by label).

If you want, I can draw a diagram showing `stack ↔ heap` arrows and object layout. Would that help?

Let me know if you want that — or if you want to explore how **Garbage Collection** works next.


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Great question — you're diving into **compile-time vs runtime**, and Java vs C++ differences in **memory, method resolution, and polymorphism**. Let's break this down step by step:

---

## 🔷 1. **Does `javac` (the Java compiler) allocate memory?**

### ❌ No, the Java **compiler (`javac`) does *not* allocate memory**.

🔧 What it does:

* Checks **syntax** (valid code or not).
* Resolves **variable declarations**, **method signatures**, **class structures**.
* **Generates bytecode** (`.class` files) — instructions for JVM.

✅ But **no stack or heap memory is created** during compilation.
That only happens when the **JVM actually runs the program** (i.e., at **runtime**).

---

## 🔷 2. **What *is* decided at compile-time?**

While compiling, Java does **some decisions statically**, like:

| Aspect                       | Decided at Compile-Time? | Notes                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Method overloading           | ✅ Yes                    | Based on method signature (name + parameters) |
| Variable types               | ✅ Yes                    | Fixed during compilation                      |
| Method overriding resolution | ❌ No                     | Done at runtime (dynamic binding)             |
| Memory layout                | ❌ No                     | Done at runtime                               |

---

## 🔷 3. **What about method overriding? Java vs C++**

### ✅ In **C++**, you need `virtual` keyword for dynamic method dispatch:

```cpp
class Base {
  virtual void show(); // needed for runtime dispatch
};
```

### ✅ In **Java**, *all non-static, non-final methods* are virtual by default.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}

Animal a = new Dog();
a.sound(); // Dog barks → Resolved at runtime
```

This is called **Dynamic Method Dispatch**, and is handled by **v-tables (virtual method tables)** internally by JVM.

---

## 🔷 4. **How does the JVM decide which method to run?**

### When the JVM runs the bytecode:

* It creates the **heap** (for objects) and **stack** (for method calls).
* It uses **method tables** and **actual object type** to decide **which method to run**.
* This is **runtime polymorphism**, handled by JVM using **dynamic dispatch**.

---

## 🔚 Summary:

| Step                  | What happens                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Compilation (`javac`) | ✅ Syntax check, ✅ Bytecode generation, ❌ No memory allocation      |
| JVM Execution         | ✅ Stack & Heap creation, ✅ Method calls, ✅ Polymorphism resolution |
