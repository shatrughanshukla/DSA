Absolutely, let’s take this deep and very visual step by step, just like we’ve been doing. Your doubt revolves around **what happens when `main()` ends**, **how stack and heap interact**, and **how garbage collection kicks in**.

---

## 🎯 GOAL: Understand this line

> "**If no other references to the heap objects exist, they become eligible for garbage collection**"

And specifically — how this works when:

```java
Student s1 = new Student();
```

...is declared **inside `main()`** and `main()` ends.

## 🧠 Background: Stack vs Heap (Quick Recap)

| Concept    | Stack                         | Heap                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Stores     | Method calls, local variables | Objects (`new`), class instances |
| Lifetime   | Short-lived (per method)      | Long-lived (until GC'd)          |
| Managed by | Java runtime                  | Java + Garbage Collector         |

---

## ✅ Code:

```java
class Student {
    int id;
    String name;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student(); // 🔗 Reference to Heap
        s1.id = 101;
        s1.name = "Shatrughan";
    } // 🔚 main() ends here
```

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Execution with Stack & Heap

### 🔸 Step 1: Program Starts

* JVM starts execution with `main()`.
* A **stack frame** is created for `main()`.

📦 **Stack:**

```
| s1 -> ???        |
|------------------|
| main() frame     |
```

📦 **Heap:**

```
(empty for now)
```

---

### 🔸 Step 2: `new Student()` is executed

* A new object of `Student` is created in **heap memory**.
* Memory address (e.g., `0xABCD`) is returned.
* `s1` in stack now points to that address.

📦 **Stack:**

```
| s1 → 0xABCD       |
|-------------------|
| main() frame      |
```

📦 **Heap:**

```
0xABCD → Student {
    id = 101,
    name = "Shatrughan"
}
```

---

### 🔸 Step 3: `main()` Ends

* The **stack frame for `main()` is removed**.
* Hence, `s1` is **deleted** from stack.

📦 **Stack:**

```
(empty — main() ended)
```

📦 **Heap:**

```
0xABCD → Student {
    id = 101,
    name = "Shatrughan"
}
```

BUT:
☠️ No variable is pointing to this `Student` object anymore!

---

### 🧹 Step 4: Garbage Collection Eligibility

* JVM sees the object in heap at `0xABCD` is **no longer reachable**.
* No reference exists in stack or in any other heap object.
* Therefore, JVM marks it as **eligible for Garbage Collection**.

> Important:
> Garbage Collection **isn't immediate** — JVM will clean it up **when it thinks it's best** (based on memory pressure, GC algorithm etc.)

---

## ✅ So Final Answer to Your Doubt:

> ❓ "If `s1` is declared in `main`, and main ends, does the object become eligible for GC?"

**✅ YES. Because:**

* `s1` was a **stack reference**
* Once `main()` ends, **stack frame is gone**
* **No other reference** to the object exists
* Hence, **heap object becomes unreachable**, and GC can collect it

---

## 🔁 Optional: What if another reference existed?

```java
Student temp; // global or class-level

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Student s1 = new Student();
    temp = s1; // now 2 references to the same heap object
}
```

Then:

📦 **Stack:**

```
(main frame destroyed after end)
```

📦 **Heap:**

```
0xABCD → Student { id = 101, name = "Shatrughan" }
```

📦 **Other:**

```
temp → 0xABCD  // still pointing
```

✅ Not eligible for GC yet.
